      "<think>\n",
      "Okay, I need to write a C++ code for binary search. Let me think about how binary search works. It's an efficient algorithm for finding an item in a sorted list. The idea is to repeatedly divide the search interval in half. \n",
      "\n",
      "First, I should start by including the necessary headers. Probably <iostream> for input output, and maybe <vector> if I want to use a vector instead of an array. Wait, the user didn't specify, but I can choose. Let's go with a regular array for simplicity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, the function. Binary search can be implemented iteratively or recursively. Which is better? Well, the iterative approach is usually preferred for arrays since it's O(log n) time and O(1) space, whereas recursion would have the same time but still use O(log n) space due to the call stack. So maybe iterative is better here.\n",
      "\n",
      "The function parameters: it needs the array, the target value, and the size. Wait, in C++, arrays decay into pointers, so when passing an array to a function, we lose the size information. So the function should take the array, low and high indices. Or maybe a function that takes the array, its size, and the target. Hmm. Let me think.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me outline the steps. Initialize low as 0 and high as (size - 1). While low is less than or equal to high. Find the middle index. Compare the middle element with the target. If equal, return the index. If the middle element is less than target, set low to mid + 1. Else, set high to mid - 1. If not found, return -1.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, the function should return the index of the target if found, else -1. So let's write that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the code structure. Let's have a function called binarySearch, which takes an array of integers, the size, and the target. Wait, but when you pass an array to a function, you can't directly pass it with the size. So the function declaration would be something like:\n",
      "\n",
      "int binarySearch(int arr[], int size, int target);\n",
      "\n",
      "But when you pass the array, the size isn't part of the array type. So the function will have to take the array and the size as parameters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the main function. Let me create a sample sorted array, maybe {2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12}, and test for a value. The user can input a value or we can hardcode some test cases.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, the user wants a code example. Let me think of a complete program. The code should include the function, then in main, test it.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the code would look something like this:\n",
      "\n",
      "#include <iostream>\n",
      "using namespace std;\n",
      "\n",
      "int binarySearch(int arr[], int size, int target) {\n",
      "    int low = 0;\n",
      "    int high = size - 1;\n",
      "    while (low <= high) {\n",
      "        int mid = low + (high - low) / 2; // To prevent possible overflow\n",
      "        if (arr[mid] == target) {\n",
      "            return mid;\n",
      "        } else if (arr[mid] < target) {\n",
      "            low = mid + 1;\n",
      "        } else {\n",
      "            high = mid - 1;\n",
      "        }\n",
      "    }\n",
      "    return -1;\n",
      "}\n",
      "\n",
      "int main() {\n",
      "    int arr[] = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12};\n",
      "    int n = sizeof(arr)/sizeof(arr[0]);\n",
      "    int target = 8;\n",
      "    int result = binarySearch(arr, n, target);\n",
      "    if (result != -1) {\n",
      "        cout << \"Element found at index \" << result << endl;\n",
      "    } else {\n",
      "        cout << \"Element not found\" << endl;\n",
      "    }\n",
      "    return 0;\n",
      "}\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but what if the array has even number of elements? Well, binary search handles that. Also, the mid calculation: why use low + (high - low)/2 instead of (low + high)/2? Oh right, to avoid integer overflow. Although in C++ with standard arrays, if the array is large enough, adding low and high could overflow. So better to compute mid as low + (high - low)/2. Which is the same as (low + high)/2, but without the risk of overflow.\n",
      "\n",
      "So that's correct. Also, the function returns the index. In main, we calculate the size of the array by dividing the total size by element size. That's correct for static arrays.\n",
      "\n",
      "Testing this code with the sample array. If target is 8, the array is {2,4,6,8,10,12}. The indexes are 0-5. First mid is (0+5)/2=2. arr[2] is 6 < 8, so low becomes 3. Next iteration, high is 5. mid is 3 + (5-3)/2 = 4? Wait, mid would be 3 + (5-3)/2 = 3 + 1 = 4. arr[4] is 10 which is > 8. So high becomes 3. Now low is 3, high is 3. mid is 3. arr[3] is 8, found. So returns 3. Which is correct.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another test case: if target is 12, returns 5. If target is 2, returns 0. What if target is 7? The array doesn't have it. The loop would exit and return -1.\n",
      "\n",
      "But what if there are duplicate elements? Well, binary search will return any occurrence, but since the problem says \"binary search\", it's assumed that the array is sorted. So if there are duplicates, it depends on the implementation. The code as written returns the first occurrence it finds. But the problem doesn't specify handling duplicates, so it's okay.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, code-wise, I think that's correct. Let me check for syntax errors. The function is declared correctly. In main, arr is a static array, passed to the function. The calculation of n is correct. The code uses cout and cin, but in main, there's no input, but output. The user can modify to take input if needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, this should work. Let me write this down.\n",
      "</think>\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a well-documented implementation of **binary search** in C++. This version uses the **iterative approach**, which is generally preferred for arrays due to its **O(log n) time complexity** and **O(1) space complexity**.\n",

      "The phrase \"Attention is All You Need\" refers to a groundbreaking 2017 research paper that introduced the **Transformer** model, a revolutionary architecture in machine learning for sequence-to-sequence tasks (e.g., language translation, text summarization). The key innovation was replacing traditional sequence-processing methods (like RNNs or CNNs) with a **self-attention mechanism**, enabling parallel processing of data and capturing long-range dependencies more effectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Key Points:\n",
      "1. **Core Idea**: The Transformer relies entirely on attention layers to weigh the importance of different parts of the input sequence dynamically.\n",
      "2. **Impact**: It became the foundation for state-of-the-art models like BERT, GPT, and others, dominating NLP tasks since its release.\n",
      "3. **Advantages**:\n",
      "   - Parallelizable training (faster than RNNs).\n",
      "   - Handles long-range dependencies better than previous models.\n",
