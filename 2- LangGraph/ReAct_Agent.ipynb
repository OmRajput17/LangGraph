       "AIMessage(content='<think>\\nOkay, the user wants me to write a C++ code for binary search. Let me think about how to approach this. Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding an item in a sorted list. It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. \\n\\nFirst, I need to decide whether to implement the iterative or recursive version. Since recursion can lead to stack overflow for large data, maybe the iterative approach is better here. Plus, it\\'s generally more efficient in terms of space.\\n\\nThe function should take a sorted array, a target value, and the size of the array. Wait, in C++, arrays are passed as pointers, so the function needs the size as a parameter. The function should return the index of the target if found, otherwise -1.\\n\\nLet me outline the steps for binary search:\\n\\n1. Initialize low as 0 and high as size - 1.\\n2. While low is less than or equal to high:\\n   a. Calculate mid as the average of low and high. But wait, using (low + high)/2 can cause integer overflow. A safer way is low + (high - low)/2.\\n   b. Compare the element at mid with the target.\\n   c. If the element is equal to the target, return mid.\\n   d. If the element is less than the target, set low to mid + 1.\\n   e. If the element is greater, set high to mid - 1.\\n3. If the loop exits without returning, return -1.\\n\\nNow, let me code this. Need to include necessary headers, like <iostream> for input output. Then write a function, maybe called binarySearch. Then a main function to test it.\\n\\nWait, the user might want to see an example. So in main, create a sample sorted array, call the function, and print the result. Let me make sure the array is sorted. For example, int arr[] = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12}; and target is 8. Then the function should return 3 (index starts at 0).\\n\\nTesting edge cases: what if the target is the first element? Or the last? Also, what if the array is empty? Oh, but in C++, if someone passes a zero-sized array, the function should handle it. In that case, the while loop won\\'t run and return -1, which is correct.\\n\\nWait, in the function parameters, the array is passed as int arr[], but in C++, when you pass an array, it decays into a pointer. So the function doesn\\'t know the size. Hence, the size must be passed as a separate parameter. That\\'s why the function signature is something like int binarySearch(int arr[], int size, int target).\\n\\nAnother thing: make sure the mid calculation is correct. Using low + (high - low) / 2 to prevent overflow. But for the problem here, if the user is using a modern compiler with 32-bit or 64-bit ints, maybe overflow isn\\'t a big concern unless dealing with extremely large arrays. But it\\'s better to use the safe approach.\\n\\nPutting it all together. Let me write the code step by step.\\n\\nFirst, include the headers. Then write the binarySearch function. Then main function. Let me test with an example.\\n\\nWait, here\\'s a possible mistake: when the array is empty, the function returns -1. Also, when the element is not present, returns -1.\\n\\nLet me test another example. Suppose array is {1,3,5,7}, target 5. Then mid would be calculated properly. Let me simulate:\\n\\nlow = 0, high = 3. mid = 1 (0+3)/2 = 1.5 -> 1. arr[1] is 3 <5. So low becomes 2. Next iteration, low=2, high=3, mid is 2 + (3-2)/2 = 2 + 0.5 = 2.5 → 2. arr[2] is 5, found. Return 2.\\n\\nYes, correct.\\n\\nNow code:\\n\\nImplementing that. Let me write the function.\\n\\nThen in main, take user input? Or just hardcode for demonstration. Probably hardcode for simplicity.\\n\\nSo the code would look like:\\n\\n#include <iostream>\\nusing namespace std;\\n\\nint binarySearch(int arr[], int size, int target) {\\n    int low = 0, high = size - 1;\\n    while (low <= high) {\\n        int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;\\n        if (arr[mid] == target) {\\n            return mid;\\n        } else if (arr[mid] < target) {\\n            low = mid + 1;\\n        } else {\\n            high = mid - 1;\\n        }\\n    }\\n    return -1;\\n}\\n\\nint main() {\\n    int arr[] = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12};\\n    int n = sizeof(arr)/sizeof(arr[0]);\\n    int target = 8;\\n    int result = binarySearch(arr, n, target);\\n    if (result != -1) {\\n        cout << \"Element found at index \" << result << endl;\\n    } else {\\n        cout << \"Element not found\" << endl;\\n    }\\n    return 0;\\n}\\n\\nWait, in main, how to calculate the size? Well, since the array is in scope, sizeof(arr)/sizeof(arr[0]) gives the number of elements. But when passing to the function, as mentioned before, the function needs the size. So in the example, that\\'s how to compute it.\\n\\nThis code should work. Let me check for possible typos. The function returns mid when found. The mid is calculated correctly. Also, the main function outputs correctly.\\n\\nWhat about when the target is not present? Let\\'s say target is 9. Then the code returns -1. Let me simulate that.\\n\\nIn the array {2,4,6,8,10,12}, target 9. Let\\'s walk through:\\n\\nInitial low=0, high=5. mid=2: arr[2]=6 <9 → low=3.\\n\\nNext, low=3, high=5, mid=3 + (5-3)/2 = 3 + 1 =4. arr[4]=10 >9 → high=3.\\n\\nNow low=3, high=3. mid=3. arr[3]=8 <9 → low=4. Now low > high. Exit loop. Return -1. Correct.\\n\\nYes, that\\'s right. So the code should work. Let me make sure that all cases are handled. Looks good. Now write the code.\\n</think>\\n\\nHere is a well-documented C++ implementation of the **binary search** algorithm using the **iterative approach**. The function assumes the input array is **sorted in ascending order**.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### ✅ Binary Search in C++\\n\\n```cpp\\n#include <iostream>\\nusing namespace std;\\n\\n// Function to perform binary search\\nint binarySearch(int arr[], int size, int target) {\\n    int low = 0;\\n    int high = size - 1;\\n\\n    while (low <= high) {\\n        // Compute mid-point safely to avoid integer overflow\\n        int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;\\n\\n        if (arr[mid] == target) {\\n            // Target found\\n            return mid;\\n        } else if (arr[mid] < target) {\\n            // Search in the right half\\n            low = mid + 1;\\n        } else {\\n            // Search in the left half\\n            high = mid - 1;\\n        }\\n    }\\n\\n    // Target not found\\n    return -1;\\n}\\n\\nint main() {\\n    // Example sorted array\\n    int arr[] = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12};\\n\\n    // Compute the size of the array\\n    int n = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);\\n\\n    // Target element to search\\n    int target = 8;\\n\\n    // Call the binary search function\\n    int result = binarySearch(arr, n, target);\\n\\n    // Display the result\\n    if (result != -1) {\\n        cout << \"Element found at index \" << result << endl;\\n    } else {\\n        cout << \"Element not found\" << endl;\\n    }\\n\\n    return 0;\\n}\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 🔍 How It Works:\\n\\n- **Binary search** works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.\\n- The function maintains two pointers: `low` (start) and `high` (end) of the current search range.\\n- At each step, the algorithm calculates the `mid` point and compares the element at that index with the `target`.\\n- If the `target` is equal to the element at `mid`, the index is returned.\\n- If the `target` is less than the `mid` element, the search continues in the **left half**.\\n- If the `target` is greater than the `mid` element, the search continues in the **right half**.\\n- The process continues until the `target` is found or the search space is exhausted.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 📝 Notes:\\n\\n- The array **must be sorted** for binary search to work correctly.\\n- This implementation uses **integer overflow-safe mid calculation**: `low + (high - low) / 2`.\\n- The function returns `-1` if the element is not found in the array.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 🧪 Example Output:\\n\\nFor input array `{2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12}` and target `8`, the output will be:\\n\\n```\\nElement found at index 3\\n```\\n\\nFor target `9`, it will output:\\n\\n```\\nElement not found\\n```', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 2057, 'prompt_tokens': 17, 'total_tokens': 2074, 'completion_time': 5.624869615, 'prompt_time': 0.000718828, 'queue_time': 0.059130672, 'total_time': 5.625588443}, 'model_name': 'qwen/qwen3-32b', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_5cf921caa2', 'service_tier': 'on_demand', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None, 'model_provider': 'groq'}, id='lc_run--10e13c3f-ee1d-49b0-9a1d-02caaa653379-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 17, 'output_tokens': 2057, 'total_tokens': 2074})"
