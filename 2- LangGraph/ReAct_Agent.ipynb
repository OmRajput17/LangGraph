       "AIMessage(content='<think>\\nOkay, I need to write a C++ code for binary search. Let me think about how binary search works. Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding an item in a sorted list. It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. \\n\\nFirst, I should make sure that the input array is sorted. Otherwise, binary search won\\'t work correctly. So, the array needs to be sorted in ascending order. \\n\\nThe basic steps are:\\n1. Initialize two pointers, low and high, to the start and end of the array.\\n2. While low is less than or equal to high, calculate the mid-point.\\n3. Compare the mid element with the target value.\\n   - If the target is equal to the mid element, return the index.\\n   - If the target is less than the mid element, adjust high to mid - 1.\\n   - If the target is greater, adjust low to mid + 1.\\n4. If the element is not found, return -1 or some indication.\\n\\nLet me think about the parameters. The function should take the array, the target value, and perhaps the low and high indices. Wait, in C++, arrays are passed as pointers, so maybe the function should take the array, its size, and the target. \\n\\nWait, when you pass an array to a function in C++, it decays into a pointer, so the function can\\'t know the size of the array unless you pass it as a parameter. So, the function will need the array, the target, the low and high indices. But maybe for simplicity, the function can take the array, the target, and the size. Wait, but for the recursive version, you need to track the current low and high. \\n\\nWait, the user didn\\'t specify if it should be iterative or recursive. Both are possible. Let me think which one is better. The iterative version is generally more efficient because recursion can have stack overhead. But either way is correct. Let me do both? Or maybe the user wants a standard iterative approach. Probably iterative is more common for binary search.\\n\\nSo, I\\'ll write an iterative version. Let\\'s outline the code:\\n\\nFunction binarySearch(int arr[], int size, int target) {\\n    int low = 0;\\n    int high = size - 1;\\n    while (low <= high) {\\n        int mid = low + (high - low) / 2; // To prevent integer overflow, though in C++ with 32-bit ints, it\\'s not a big issue unless very large arrays\\n        if (arr[mid] == target) {\\n            return mid;\\n        } else if (arr[mid] < target) {\\n            low = mid + 1;\\n        } else {\\n            high = mid - 1;\\n        }\\n    }\\n    return -1;\\n}\\n\\nWait, but what about when the array is empty? Well, if size is 0, high would be -1, but in that case, the loop doesn\\'t execute, and returns -1, which is correct.\\n\\nNow, let me think about the main function. The user might want to test the code. So, I can create a sample sorted array and test some cases.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\nint main() {\\n    int arr[] = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9};\\n    int size = sizeof(arr)/sizeof(arr[0]);\\n    int target = 7;\\n    int result = binarySearch(arr, size, target);\\n    if (result != -1) {\\n        cout << \"Element found at index \" << result << endl;\\n    } else {\\n        cout << \"Element not found.\" << endl;\\n    }\\n    return 0;\\n}\\n\\nBut wait, the function needs to be properly declared. Also, need to include headers like iostream for cout. Also, the function returns the index, which is correct.\\n\\nWait, but in C++, the indexes start at 0. So that\\'s correct.\\n\\nPotential issues: What if the array has duplicate elements? Well, binary search will return one of the occurrences, but the exact one depends on the implementation. Since the problem says \"binary search\", it\\'s okay as long as it finds a correct position if the element is present.\\n\\nAnother thing: the mid calculation. Using (low + high)/2 could potentially overflow if low and high are large. So using low + (high - low)/2 is safer. But in C++, integers can overflow, but for the sake of example, maybe the user is okay with either. But I\\'ll use the safer version.\\n\\nPutting it all together:\\n\\nInclude the function, main function, etc.\\n\\nNow, code:\\n\\n#include <iostream>\\nusing namespace std;\\n\\nint binarySearch(int arr[], int size, int target) {\\n    int low = 0;\\n    int high = size - 1;\\n    while (low <= high) {\\n        int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;\\n        if (arr[mid] == target) {\\n            return mid;\\n        } else if (arr[mid] < target) {\\n            low = mid + 1;\\n        } else {\\n            high = mid - 1;\\n        }\\n    }\\n    return -1;\\n}\\n\\nint main() {\\n    int arr[] = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17};\\n    int size = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);\\n    int target = 9;\\n    int result = binarySearch(arr, size, target);\\n    if (result != -1) {\\n        cout << \"Element found at index \" << result << endl;\\n    } else {\\n        cout << \"Element not found.\" << endl;\\n    }\\n\\n    // Test with an element not present\\n    target = 8;\\n    result = binarySearch(arr, size, target);\\n    if (result != -1) {\\n        cout << \"Element found at index \" << result << endl;\\n    } else {\\n        cout << \"Element not found.\" << endl;\\n    }\\n\\n    return 0;\\n}\\n\\nThis should work. Let me check for possible errors. For example, when the array is size 1, or when the target is the first or last element.\\n\\nAnother thing: the array must be sorted. The code assumes that. So in the example, the array is sorted. \\n\\nYes, the code should work. Let me test in my mind. For the first test, target is 9. The array is 1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17. Size is 9. Initial low 0, high 8. mid is 4, arr[4] is 9. Found immediately. So returns 4. Which is correct.\\n\\nSecond test target 8. Let\\'s see:\\n\\nInitial low 0, high 8. mid is 4 (arr[4] 9). 9 > 8, so high becomes 3. Next loop: low 0, high 3. mid is 1 (0 + (3-0)/2 = 1). arr[1] is 3 < 8. So low becomes 2. Next mid is (2+3)/2=2.5 => 2. arr[2] is 5 <8. low becomes 3. Now mid is 3+ (3-3)/2=3. arr[3] is 7 <8. low becomes 4. Now low > high (4 >3). Exit loop. Return -1. Correct, since 8 is not present.\\n\\nLooks good. So the code should work. Now, write the code as per the user\\'s request.\\n</think>\\n\\nHere is a well-documented C++ implementation of the **Binary Search** algorithm using an **iterative approach**. This algorithm assumes the input array is sorted in ascending order and efficiently finds the index of a target value using the divide-and-conquer strategy.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### ✅ **Binary Search in C++**\\n\\n```cpp\\n#include <iostream>\\nusing namespace std;\\n\\n// Function to perform binary search\\nint binarySearch(int arr[], int size, int target) {\\n    int low = 0;\\n    int high = size - 1;\\n\\n    while (low <= high) {\\n        // Compute mid-point to prevent potential integer overflow\\n        int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;\\n\\n        if (arr[mid] == target) {\\n            return mid; // Target found, return index\\n        } else if (arr[mid] < target) {\\n            low = mid + 1; // Search in the right half\\n        } else {\\n            high = mid - 1; // Search in the left half\\n        }\\n    }\\n\\n    return -1; // Target not found\\n}\\n\\n// Main function to test the binary search algorithm\\nint main() {\\n    // Sorted array for binary search\\n    int arr[] = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17};\\n    int size = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);\\n\\n    // Test case: Element present in the array\\n    int target1 = 9;\\n    int result1 = binarySearch(arr, size, target1);\\n    if (result1 != -1) {\\n        cout << \"Element \" << target1 << \" found at index \" << result1 << endl;\\n    } else {\\n        cout << \"Element \" << target1 << \" not found.\" << endl;\\n    }\\n\\n    // Test case: Element not present in the array\\n    int target2 = 8;\\n    int result2 = binarySearch(arr, size, target2);\\n    if (result2 != -1) {\\n        cout << \"Element \" << target2 << \" found at index \" << result2 << endl;\\n    } else {\\n        cout << \"Element \" << target2 << \" not found.\" << endl;\\n    }\\n\\n    return 0;\\n}\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 🔍 **Explanation**\\n\\n- **`binarySearch` Function**:\\n  - Takes a sorted array (`arr[]`), the size of the array (`size`), and the `target` value to search for.\\n  - Uses two pointers, `low` and `high`, to define the current search range.\\n  - In each iteration:\\n    - Computes the `mid` index.\\n    - If `arr[mid] == target`, returns `mid` as the index.\\n    - If `arr[mid] < target`, search continues in the right half (`low = mid + 1`).\\n    - If `arr[mid] > target`, search continues in the left half (`high = mid - 1`).\\n  - If the loop exits without finding the target, returns `-1`.\\n\\n- **`main` Function**:\\n  - Initializes a sorted array and calculates its size.\\n  - Runs two test cases: one with a target that exists in the array and one that does not.\\n  - Prints the result accordingly.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 📌 **Important Notes**\\n- **Time Complexity**: O(log n), since the search space is halved in each step.\\n- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as no additional space is used.\\n- **Array Must Be Sorted**: Binary search only works correctly on sorted arrays. Sorting is a prerequisite for this algorithm.\\n- **Avoids Integer Overflow**: The mid-point is calculated using `low + (high - low) / 2` instead of `(low + high) / 2` to prevent overflow in large arrays.\\n\\n---\\n\\nThis implementation is efficient, readable, and suitable for most practical applications of binary search in C++.', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 2425, 'prompt_tokens': 17, 'total_tokens': 2442, 'completion_time': 5.970920026, 'prompt_time': 0.000488693, 'queue_time': 0.056497546, 'total_time': 5.971408719}, 'model_name': 'qwen/qwen3-32b', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_5cf921caa2', 'service_tier': 'on_demand', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None, 'model_provider': 'groq'}, id='lc_run--3a652580-9bd1-4ee7-83e7-767a5b7a9d77-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 17, 'output_tokens': 2425, 'total_tokens': 2442})"
